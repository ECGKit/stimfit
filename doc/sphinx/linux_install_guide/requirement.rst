This document describes how to install `Stimfit <http://www.stimfit.org>`_ |version| under GNU/Linux. The installation was tested on a GNU/Debian testing/unstable system, with a 2.6-based kernel and with support for Python 2.5. and Python 2.6. It should work on other Debian-based systems (e.g Ubuntu) aswith newer version of Stimfit as well. I assume that you have the GNU C compiler (gcc) and the GNU C++ compiler (g++) already installed in your system. Please, check that both versions match. For our installation we will use gcc-4.2.4 and the same version of g++.

============================
What we need before we start
============================

For the impatient, here are all `Stimfit <http://www.stimfit.org>`_ build dependencies:

::

    $ sudo apt-get install libboost-dev \
                           python-dev \
                           python-numpy \
                           python-matplotlib \
                           libhdf5-serial-dev \
                           swig \
                           python-wxgtk2.8 \
                           libwxgtk2.8-dev \
                           fftw3-dev \
                           liblapack-dev \
                           chrpath \
                           git \
                           automake \
                           autoconf \
                           libtool \
                           libgtest-dev


This will get you, amongst others:

* [boost]_: C++ library that is mainly used for its shared pointers.
* [Lapack]_: A linear algebra library.
* [fftw]_:  Library for computing Fourier transformations.
* [NumPy]_: To handle multidimensional arrays and perform more complex numerical computations with Python.
* [HDF5]_: This is the hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) to manage large amount of data.

In addition, you can install doxygen, python-sphinx and graphviz if you want to build yourself the documentation.

=======================
Optional: wxWidgets 2.9
=======================

* [wxWidgets]_ and [wxPython]_ 2.9 (unstable): If you'd like to live on the bleeding edge and get decent printing support through gtk-print, you can build against wxWidgets 2.9, which in turn needs to be built from source. To get the build dependencies (which are the same as for 2.8), do:

::

    $  sudo apt-get build-dep wxwidgets2.8

Get the source for both wxWidgets and wxPython in a single tarball:

::

    $ wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPython-src-2.9.1.1.tar.bz2
    $ tar xvfj wxPython-src-2.9.1.1.tar.bz2

Check http://www.wxpython.org/download.php#unstable for updates.

From there, follow the build instructions found `here <http://www.wxpython.org/builddoc.php>`_

=======================
Optional: PyEMF
=======================

[PyEMF]_ is needed to export figures to the windows meta file format (WMF/EMF). EMF is a vector graphics format and can be imported in different Office software including LibreOffice. In order to install it, do:

::

     $ wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyemf/files/pyemf/2.0.0/pyemf-2.0.0.tar.gz/download -O pyemf-2.0.0.tar.gz
     $ tar xvf pyemf-2.0.0.tar.gz && cd pyemf-2.0.0
     $ sudo python setup.py install


================================
Download the Stimfit source code
================================

You can download the latest development code for `Stimfit <http://www.stimfit.org>`_ from the `Github code repository <https://github.com/neurodroid/stimfit/>`_. For that, type from your current $HOME directory: 

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/neurodroid/stimfit.git 

This will grab all the required files into $HOME/stimfit. If you'd like to update at a later point, do:

::

    $ cd $HOME/stimfit
    $ git pull

=============
Build Stimfit
=============

Go to the stimfit directory (in our example $HOME/stimfit) and type:

::

    $ ./autogen.sh

to generate the configure script. Remember that we need Autoconf, Automake and LibTool to use autogen. After that, you can call it with

::

    $ ./configure --enable-python

The **--enable-python** option is absolutely necessary to install `Stimfit <http://www.stimfit.org>`_ since some of the functionality depends on Python. The configure script has some additional options. For example, we may want to use `IPython <http://www.scipy.org>`_  instead of the default embedded python shell with the option **---enable-ipython**  (note that the `IPython <http://www.scipy.org>`_ shell is only available under GNU/Linux and it is still very experimental). 



Finally, after running configure, you can type

::

    $ make -j[N]

where [N] is the number of parallel builds you want to start. And finally:

::

    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo /sbin/ldconfig

.. note::

    If you want to install Stimfit as local user (e.g in ~/.local) with a local version of Python (e.g ~/.local/lib/python2.6) you have to add the following argument to configure
    script:

    $ ./configure --prefix= $HOME/.local PYTHON = $HOME/.local/lib/python2.6 --enable-python

    and after that call **make** and **make install** as normal user. The Stimfit executable will be now in $HOME/.local

==========================================
Building Stimfit with BioSig import filter
==========================================

It is recommended to build `Stimfit <http://www.stimfit.org>`_  with the `BioSig <http://biosig.sourceforge.net>`_ import the file filters to read HEKA files or to have the possibility import some other file formats used biomedical signal processing. To do it, follow this instructions:

1. It is first recommended to install libsuitesparse and libz libraries:

::

    sudo apt-get install libsuitesparse-dev libz-dev gawk

2. Download BioSig sources: you can obtain the latest BioSig version in `BioSig downloads <http://biosig.sourceforge.net/download.html>`_ . Choose BioSig for C/C++, libbiosig (v1.5.6 or higher is recommended). Alternatively, you can obtain the latest developmental version from the git repository:

::

    git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/biosig/code biosig-code

3. Compile and install the sources: enter the directory **biosig4c++** and type: 

::

    make 
    sudo make install

After that you can enter the option --with-biosig in the configure script of `Stimfit <http://www.stimfit.org>`_ and compile as usual.

======================
Building documentation
======================

The manual of `Stimfit <http://www.stimfit.org>`_ including the documentation is accessible on-line in http://www.stimfit.org/doc/sphix/. To have your own local copy of the documentation, you will need to install sphinx:

::

    sudo apt-get install python-sphinx

It is possible to build a local copy of the documentation there by calling:

::

    sphinx-build $HOME/Stimfit/doc/sphinx/ <destinyFolder> 

The html documentation will be located in <destinyFolder>/index.html 

Additionally, the source code is documented with [Doxygen]_ and is also accessible on-line in http://www.stimfit.org/doc/doxygen/html/. If you want to have a local copy of the documentation, you will need to install the doxygen and gravphvix:

::

    sudo apt-get install doxygen gravphvix

Enter a directory called **doc** inside Stimfit (e.g $HOME/stimfit/doc) and type:

::

    doxygen DoxyFile

The local documentation of the source code will be in $HOME/stimfit/doc/doxygen/html
